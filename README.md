# 🧭 POE2GPS

### Your turn-by-turn GPS for the wilds of Wraeclast.

*A strictly **read-only** navigation overlay for Path of Exile 2 — it shows you where to go, and never touches your game.*

## ✨ Why POE2GPS

You attach it, it reads the game's map out of memory, and it **draws a radar + a route line** to wherever you're headed. No more squinting at the minimap or alt-tabbing to a wiki — the path is on your screen. And because it's a focused, community-safe fork of [Sikaka/POE2Radar](https://github.com/Sikaka/POE2Radar), it deliberately strips everything that could get you flagged.

## 🛡️ What it does — and never does

POE2GPS does three things **never** — and an automated compliance gate *fails the build* if any of them sneak back in:

| 🚫 Never | ✅ Instead |
|---|---|
| Sends input to the game (no `SendInput`, no auto-flask, no automation) | Just **draws** — you press every key yourself |
| Writes to / injects into the game (no `WriteProcessMemory`, no byte-patching) | Opens the game **read-only** (`PROCESS_VM_READ`) |
| Phones home (no poe.ninja pricing, no telemetry) | Everything is **local** |

> **Honest note on risk.** Reading another process's memory is a gray area — GGG has long been agnostic toward passive read-only overlays, but it's *tolerated, not blessed*. POE2GPS removes the categories GGG explicitly prohibits (input automation, process modification) to sit in the lowest-risk bucket. It's a personal/educational tool; you're responsible for how you use it. SmartScreen/AV may warn on an unsigned memory-reading exe — expected.

## 🗺️ Features

- 🛰️ **Entity radar** — enemies, NPCs, chests, transitions, players, and POIs; optional world-space HP bars; dangerous rare/magic mods flagged.
- 🧱 **Terrain + map overlay** — the walkable-terrain mask and entity dots, projected onto the in-game map.
- 📍 **Tile landmarks** — boss arenas, transitions, reward rooms, surfaced the moment you enter a zone, with community-curated names.
- 🧭 **Navigation** — pick any landmark/POI/entity and get a smoothed A* route drawn to it (on the map, or as world waypoints). Multi-select, each its own color. **Cycle** the active target hands-free — keyboard (`Ctrl+Alt+]`/`[`) or controller (**R3 / L3**). **Draw-only — never sends input to the game.**
- 🌌 **Atlas overlay + route planning** — labels nodes by content, off-screen arrows to tracked maps, shortest-hop auto-routes.
- 💎 **Dynasty-support maps** *(opt-in)* — highlight the endgame maps whose Anomaly bosses drop Lineage/Dynasty support gems (Sealed Vault, Sacred Reservoir, Derelict Mansion, The Jade Isles), each labeled with the gems it drops — full Citadel-style ring + arrow + track. Toggle in Settings; a dashboard reference card lists every map · boss · gems.
- 🏷️ **Reward/name labels** — names of ground drops and Ritual / Runeforge / monolith rewards (no economy values).
- 🧪 **Objective Director** *(experimental, off by default)* — auto-routes you through a zone's objectives in priority order: **seasonal event → side bosses → side zones → exit**. Still maturing — [roadmap below](#-roadmap).
- 🗺️ **Entity Atlas** — name every entity the radar doesn't recognize (your names show on the radar instantly), classify the notable ones into Director objectives, and **export/import shareable packs** — or **one-click Contribute** straight to the project (set up your own collector via [`cloudflare-worker/`](cloudflare-worker/)). Submitted names get folded into the built-in table each release — a community effort to [map the whole game](docs/CONTRIBUTING-atlas.md).
- ⭐ **God-Roll Detector** *(experimental, off by default)* — scores your inventory items 0–100 and stars the god rolls, with **meta-derived starter weights** distilled from the current ladder so it works the moment you switch it on. One-click stat-id chips to tune what you value, rarity-colored items, per-affix **tier (T#/N) + % of max roll** (so you see *how good* a roll is, not just *that* the stat matters), and a green→red **score heatmap grid**. Dashboard **Gear** tab; reads inventory only while enabled.
- 🎨 **Customizable icons & display rules** — per-rule shape/color/size, editable live; drop your own `*.svg` into `icons/`.
- 🕵️ **Stealth / low footprint** — relaunches under a random-named hardlink, randomized window class/title, neutral assembly name + binary metadata, character name never exposed, release binary string-scrubbed, and **hidden from screen capture** (screenshots / OBS / share-screen) by default — toggle off in Settings if you want to capture the overlay itself.
- 🖥️ **Web dashboard** (`http://localhost:7777`, or **F12**) — click any entity/landmark to navigate to it; tune radar/icons/atlas. Local-only, loopback-gated.

## 🚀 Download (no build required)

Grab the latest **`POE2GPS-vX.Y.Z-win-x64.zip`** from the [**Releases**](https://github.com/luther-rotmg/POE2GPS/releases) page, unzip, and run **`Overlay.exe` as Administrator** (memory reads require it) with PoE2 already running. Self-contained — no .NET install needed. *(It relaunches itself once under a random name — that's the process-randomization feature, not malware.)*

## ⌨️ Hotkeys

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| **F12** | open the web dashboard |
| **L3 + R3** / **Ctrl + Alt + M** | toggle the top-left nav-menu list |
| **Ctrl + Alt + ] / [** *(or **R3 / L3**)* | cycle active nav target next / prev |
| **Ctrl + Alt + 1–9 / 0** | jump to nav target slot / clear |
| **F6 / F7** | route to nearest landmark/POI / clear routes |
| **F10** | (Atlas open) inspect hovered tile, set route start/end |
| **F9** | quit (or right-click tray → Exit) |

*(All hotkeys are **read-only** and fire only while PoE2 is focused — keys are read, never sent to the game. No F8 — auto-flask was removed on purpose.)*

## 🔧 Build from source

Requires the **.NET 10 SDK**, Windows x64.

```bash
dotnet build POE2Radar.slnx
# then, with PoE2 running and you in a zone (as Administrator):
src\POE2Radar.Overlay\bin\Debug\net10.0-windows\Overlay.exe
```

## ✅ Compliance — how this stays safe

The three invariants above aren't just a promise — `scripts/compliance-gate.ps1` scans the shipped source and **fails the build** if any input-emission or process-write API (`SendInput`, `WriteProcessMemory`, `VirtualProtectEx`, `CreateRemoteThread`, …) appears, or if `OpenProcess` ever asks for write access. It runs in CI on every push/PR, and locally:

```bash
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/compliance-gate.ps1
```

It also catches accidentally re-introducing removed code when merging upstream from Sikaka — see [docs/upstream-merge.md](docs/upstream-merge.md).

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **`src/POE2Radar.Core`** — read-only memory plumbing (`OpenProcess` read-only + `NtReadVirtualMemory`), the PoE2 offset table, the live read layer, the `Stealth/RandomName` generator, and the `Campaign/` objective catalog + director.
- **`src/POE2Radar.Overlay`** — the overlay `.exe` (`Overlay.exe`): attaches, AOB-resolves the game roots, runs the tick loop, renders the Direct2D overlay, serves the dashboard. Reads only.
- **`src/POE2Radar.Research`** — dev-time offset discovery tools. Never shipped; excluded from the gate.

PoE2 offsets drift with patches — validated values live in `Game/Poe2Offsets.cs`; re-discover via the Research probes or pull updates from Sikaka.

## 🧪 Roadmap

The **Objective Director** is the headline work-in-progress. Next up: deep detection/cataloging of every relevant POI (seasonal events, passive-point upgrades, free skill/support gems), richer priority tiers, and — the dream — quest-aware cross-zone guidance that reads your quest log and points you to the right zone.
